# C Learn

Welcome to **C Learn** â€” a personal documentation and learning repository for the C programming language.  
This repository is built as I study C, step by step, by writing lessons, code examples, and explanations to reinforce what I learn.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Learn and document the fundamentals of the C language.
- Create clear, practical lessons for future reference.
- Provide simple code examples for each concept.
- Help others who are also starting to learn C.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository is organized into a series of **lessons**, each covering a specific topic in C. Every lesson typically includes:
- A clear explanation of the concept  
- Code examples with comments  
- Output examples  
- Common mistakes or tips
